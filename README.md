# Steam Server Manager

This is meant to be a utility for managing running steam dedicated servers.

Currently it's just a little CRUD app around that.

There is a previous attempt at this that sort of became derailed so this is a second attempt. I didn't get rid of the previous one since the general patterns should still be good and I can probably steal lots of stuff from it.

## Dependencies

### Actix-web

Trying actix-web this time instead of rocket, seems to be going well enough for the CRUD portions at least
